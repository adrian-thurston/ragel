Installing
=========

Installing on a linux system is a breeze

[source,bash]
----
wget -q http://www.colm.net/files/colm/thurston-phdthesis.pdf
wget -q http://www.colm.net/files/colm/colm-0.13.0.4.tar.gz
tar -xaf colm-0.13.0.4.tar.gz
cd colm-0.13.0.4
./configure --prefix=/opt/colm
make
sudo make install
----

When we do:

----
/opt/colm/bin/colm
----

We get:

----
error: colm: colm: no input file given
----

It works!

== First impression

When we look a little bit closer we see that colm:

* is able to be build as a static and/or shared libray.
* is licenced under GPL 2
* is equiped with a vim syntax highlighting file
* is using the aapl (LGPL 2.1 licenced) library from Adrian Thurston (just like ragel does).
* There is one file in the repository that stands out: 'colm.lm'
  In the Ragel repository there are also serveral '.lm' files. And it's syntax looks like the colm language that is presented in the thesis.
