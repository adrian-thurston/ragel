Def
===

The 'def' is where colm realy shines.
A 'def' is somewhere between a struct and a regular expression.
Again one example is much more clearer.

[source,chapel]
.assign.lm
----
include::code/assign.lm[]
----

After the compilation we can pipe some input to it's stdin.

[source,bash]
----
/opt/colm/bin/colm assign.lm
echo -e 'b=3;a=1;\n c=2;' |./assign
----

This gives us:

----
b->3
a->1
c->2
----

NOTE: this also illustrates how to read from 'stdin'.
