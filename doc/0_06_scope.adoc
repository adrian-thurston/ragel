Scope
=====

We saw in the previous paragraph that functions can be used, and that they can have parameter.
This forces us to clarify 'scope'.

[source,chapel]
./scope.lm
----
include::code/scope.lm[]
----

We run it with
[source,bash]
----
/opt/colm/bin/colm scope.lm
./scope
----

That gives us:
----
in global global
in A global
in B a
in B b
in A a
in global global
in C NIL
in C c
in global c
----

The thesis also mentions that variables can be passed by reference instead of by value.

[source,chapel]
.nested_scope.lm
----
include::code/nested_scope.lm[]
----

That gives us:
----
in global global
in A global
in B a
in B b
in A a
in global global
in C NIL
in C c
in global c
----

[source,bash]
----
/opt/colm/bin/colm nested_scope.lm
./nested_scope
----

It seems that this is still the case.
----
in global global
before block1 global
in block1 block1
in loop block1a
in block1 block1a
in A block1a
in global global
----
